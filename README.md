# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I am 27 years old, and I live in Louisville, KY. My big three astrology signs are: Libra Sun, Aquarius Moon, Scorpio Rising.
I have two cats named Chloe and Alice. 
In my free time, I like to make collages out of magazine clippings, stickers and washi tape. I also like collecting pink depression glass.
I'm taking this course because I am a data analyst at a tech consultancy, and I think learning SQL and Python will benefit my clients.
